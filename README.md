Using a random password generator provides several benefits. Firstly, it ensures that the passwords generated are highly secure and difficult to guess, as they are not based on personal information or common patterns. Additionally, using unique passwords for each account enhances security by reducing the risk of multiple accounts being compromised if one password is exposed.
